   pintos -v -k --fs-disk=2 --qemu -p ../examples/longrun_nowait -a nowait -p ../examples/generic_parent -a generic_parent -p ../examples/busy -a dummy -- -f -q run 'nowait 10 50'

   Start a lot of processes and let them finish to test if we
   eventually run out of process slots.
 
    'longrun_nowait 10 50'
 
   Will call generic_parent to start 10 children 50 times (500
   processes). One slot will be used by longrun_nowait itself. 50
   slots will be used by generic_parent (they must be kept so long as
   longrun_nowait still execute, since it may want to wait for any of
   them). All other slots needed should also be freed as soon as both
   generic_parent and it's set of children exits.
  
   To run the test effectively, if you have a limit on number of
   processes, lower that limit to 61 processes and run this test like
 
    'longrun_nowait 10 50'
 
   Note that some pintos tests requires at least 16 simultaneous
   processes to work, so be sure to increase the limit before running
   pintos tests.
